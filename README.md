General API classes
-------------------

The API is is located at [ga-api directory](ga-api)

* `Gene` is marker interface. Elements of the complete solution should implement this interface.
* A `Chromosome` is a posible solution of the problem. The `fitnessValue` indicates how good or bad is the solution.
* `GaParameters` are the general parameters of all Genetic Algorithms.
* `Population` are a collection of chromosomes sorted by their fitness values.
* `BaseGaProblem` is the base of a Genetic Algorithm and implements the following operators:
    - Selection
    - Crossover
    - Mutation
    - Elitism

    > Problems must extend this class and implement crossover and mutation operators

Implemented examples
--------------------

* Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is located at [ga-tsp directory](ga-tsp)
* Knapsack Problem (KP) is located at [ga-kp directory](ga-kp)
